Since `AUTHORS.md` is becoming increasingly out of date, I'm going to use this opportunity to thank all the earliest testers and contributors. They came at a time when auto-editor was just a little Python script and helped bring the way auto-editor is today.

Note: `@` signifies GitHub users. Names with `#` are Discord users with their four-digit discriminators
